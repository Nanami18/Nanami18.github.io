Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), where I will be advised by Professor [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) and Professor [Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/). I'm interested in all things related to language models, particularly in activation engineering, post-training, scientific undertanding of LLM, and efficiency.

I'm currently interning with Together AI, working on adapting LLM for efficiency. In Summer 2023, I interned with the CodeWhisperer team at Amazon, where I worked on efficient long-context langauge modeling.

I completed both my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and I was very fortunate to be part of Professor [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/)'s Lab.

During my undergraduate years, I also worked in Professor [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/)'s lab on computer vision and robotics.

Thanks to [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/), [Aaron Walsman](https://github.com/aaronwalsman) and other amazing collaborators at UW for their mentorship and career advices, I was able to gain research experience and navigate through the academia :)

Being a teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity besides doing research. Being 9-quarters TA at UW on algorithm, discrete math, and introductory cs theory, I'm grateful to be able to teach these materials to the excellent audience at the Allen school.
