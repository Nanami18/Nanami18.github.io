Hi! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I completed my Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S.) and mathematics (B.A.) in 2022. I expect to earn my Master's degree by Spring 2024.

I'm very fortunate to be part of Professor [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/)'s Lab. Over the past year, I worked with [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/) on investigating the compositional abilities in language models, and exploring the phenomenon of hallucination snowballing.

During my undergraduate years, I also worked in Professor [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/)'s lab on unseen object segmentation and tracking, reinforcement learning, and interactive structural understanding.

Thanks to [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/), [Aaron Walsman](https://github.com/aaronwalsman) and other amazing collaborators at UW for their mentorship and career advices, I was able to gain research experience and navigate through the academia :)

Being a teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity besides doing research. Being 7-quarters TA at UW on algorithm, discrete math, and introductory cs theory, I'm grateful to be able to teach these materials to the excellent audience at the Allen school.
