Hi! I'm a Master student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I completed my Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S.) and mathematics (B.A.) in 2022.

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision and I'm very fortunate to work with Professor [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/) and Professor [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/).

Being teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity beside doing research. I'm glad to be able to work with [Robbie Weber](https://weberrobbie.com/) and a group of passionate TA colleagues in the past year to teach on a variety of theory courses.
