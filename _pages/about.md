Hi! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I completed my Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S.) and mathematics (B.A.) in 2022.

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision and I'm very fortunate to work in Professor [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/)'s Lab. In the past summer, I worked with [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/) on investigating the compositional abilities in language models, and also developed a new prompting method that improves the ability of language models to answer complex questions.

During my undergraduate years, I also worked in Professor [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/)'s lab on unseen object segmentation and tracking, reinforcement learning, and interactive structural understanding.

Thanks to [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/), [Aaron Walsman](https://github.com/aaronwalsman) and other amazing collaborators at UW for their mentorship and career advices, I was able to do research and navigate through the academia :)

Being a teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity besides doing research. I'm glad to be able to work with [Robbie Weber](https://weberrobbie.com/) and a group of passionate TA colleagues in the past year to teach on a variety of theory courses.
