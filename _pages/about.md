Hi! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), where I completed my Bachelor's degrees of computer science (B.S.) and mathematics (B.A.) in 2022.

I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision and I'm very fortunate to work in Professor [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/)'s Lab. Previously, I have worked in Professor [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/)'s lab on unseen object segmentation and tracking, reinforcement learning, and interactive structural understanding.

Being teaching assistant is my most enjoyable extracurricular acitivity besides doing research. I'm glad to be able to work with [Robbie Weber](https://weberrobbie.com/) and a group of passionate TA colleagues in the past year to teach on a variety of theory courses.

You can download my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DfO7T5a0yUr9wjRBIrwiBm7Ft5Oz3vWn/view?usp=sharing).
