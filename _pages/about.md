Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at the [University of Southern California](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), advised by Prof. [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) and Prof. [Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in understanding language model internal to:
- Elicit desired behavior through activation engineering
- Inform model compression techniques by identifying important and redundant components
- Investigate when and why a model might fail

I'm currently a student researcher at Google Deepmind working on language model architectures. In the past, I have interned at TogetherAI and the CodeWhisperer team at Amazon on various language model effciency and architecture design related projects. 

I completed both my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree at [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and I was very fortunate to be mentored by Prof. [Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/), [Ofir Press](https://ofir.io/), and [Aaron Walsman](https://github.com/aaronwalsman). I'm grateful for all my amazing collaborators and mentors at UW for their help and guidance on research.

I love teaching and had plenty of joys as a teaching assistant at UW for 9-quarters, it was my pleasure to be able to teach computer science to the excellent audience at the Allen school :)
